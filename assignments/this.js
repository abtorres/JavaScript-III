* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. global binding - without any context 'this' will refer to the global object. the global object being the window.
* 2. implicit binding - javascript will look and say that 'this' must be the thing before the dot.
* 3. new binding - here 'this' refers to whatever object is returned by the constructor function.
* 4. explicit binding - 'this' is explicit whenever the 'call' or 'apply' methods are used.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
